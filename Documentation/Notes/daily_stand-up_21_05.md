**Are there any confusions or questions?**

- Clarification regarding the file structure
  - The frontend has a structure we can follow. I can copy/paste the structure on main when we have all or most of the current frontend issues on the main branch.
  - The backend does not have a clear file structure (we did not have time)
    - Should we follow the structure we made with Sebbe or do research on how to structure a project in express?

```ts
|src
||-> controllers
||--> nameController.ts

||-> routes
||--> name.ts
