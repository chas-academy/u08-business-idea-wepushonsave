### Styleguide

_We have decided to work with ESLint for linting and Prettier for formatting our code._
_The standard we will follow for linting is the **Airbnb** standard because of itÂ´s wide use range_

**ESLint**
_Standard rules provided by ESLint as recommendation with small modifications to work with TypeScript. This standard might change throughout this project due to inexperience with such technologies_

**Prettier**
_The way we set our formatting configurations (prettier), is by taking insperation from the [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/.prettierrc.js) page on github_
_This way we can be sure that our code is up to par with the framework we will be using for the frontend._
